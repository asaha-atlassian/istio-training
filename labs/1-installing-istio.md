# Lab: Installing Istio

In this lab, we will install Istio on your Kubernetes cluster using the Istio operator.

## Prerequisites

To install Istio, we will need a running instance of a Kubernetes cluster. All cloud providers have a managed Kubernetes cluster offering we can use to install Istio service mesh.

We can also run a Kubernetes cluster locally on your computer using one of the following platforms:

- [Minikube](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/minikube/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/docker/)
- [kind](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/kind/)
- [MicroK8s](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/microk8s/)

When using a local Kubernetes cluster, make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements for Istio installation (e.g. 16384 MB RAM and 4 CPUs). Also, ensure the Kubernetes cluster version is v1.19.0 or higher.

In this training you will be using a Kubernetes instance running on Google Cloud Platform.

The instructor will give you account information you can use to log into [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

Once logged in, click the Active Cloud Shell button on the top-right of the screen as shown in the figure below:

### Install GetIstio CLI

The first step is to download GetIstio CLI. You can install GetIstio on macOS and Linux platforms. We can use the following command to download the latest version of GetIstio and certified Istio:

```sh
curl -sL https://tetrate.bintray.com/getistio/download.sh | bash
```

We can run the version command to ensure GetIstio is successfully installed. For example:

```sh
$ getistio version
getistio version: 1.0.5
active istioctl: 1.9.1-tetrate-v0
no running Istio pods in "istio-system"
1.9.1-tetrate-v0
```

The version command outputs the version of GetIstio, the version of active Istio CLI, and versions of Istio installed on the Kubernetes cluster.

## Install Istio

GetIstio communicates with the active Kubernetes cluster from the Kubernetes config file. Make sure you have the correct Kubernetes context selected (`kubectl config get-contexts`) before installing Istio.

The recommended profile for production deployments is the `default` profile. We will be installing the `demo` profile as it contains all core components, has a high level of tracing and logging enabled, and is meant for learning about different Istio features.

We can also start with the `minimal` component and individually install other features, like ingress and egress gateway, later.

To install the demo profile of Istio on a currently active Kubernetes cluster, we can use the `getistio istioctl` command like this:

```sh
getistio istioctl install --set profile=demo
```

GetIstio will check the cluster to make sure it is ready for Istio installation and it will install Istio once you confirm the installation.

Once the installation completes, we can run the version again (`getistio version`) youâ€™ll notice that the output shows the control plane and data plane versions installed on the cluster.

```sh
$ getistio version
getistio version: 1.0.5
active istioctl: 1.9.1-tetrate-v0
client version: 1.9.1-tetrate-v0
control plane version: 1.9.1-tetrate-v0
data plane version: 1.9.1-tetrate-v0 (2 proxies)
```

To check the status of the installation, we can look at the status of the Pods in the `istio-system` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get po -n istio-system
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-egressgateway-6db9994577-sn95p    1/1     Running   0          79s
istio-ingressgateway-58649bfdf4-cs4fk   1/1     Running   0          79s
istiod-dd4b7db5-nxrjv                   1/1     Running   0          111s
```

The operator has finished installing Istio when all Pods are running.

## Enable sidecar injection 

As we've learned in the previous section, service mesh needs the sidecar proxies running alongside each application.

To inject the sidecar proxy into an existing Kubernetes deployment, we can use `kube-inject` action in the `istioctl` command.

However, we can also enable automatic sidecar injection on any Kubernetes namespace. If we label the namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`, Istio automatically injects the sidecars for any Kubernetes Pods we create in that namespace. 

Let's enable automatic sidecar injection on the `default` namespace by adding a label:

```bash
$ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
namespace/default labeled
```

To check the namespace is labeled, run the command below. The `default` namespace should be the only one with the value `enabled`.

```bash
$ kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
NAME              STATUS   AGE   ISTIO-INJECTION
default           Active   32m   enabled
istio-operator    Active   27m   disabled
istio-system      Active   15m
kube-node-lease   Active   32m
kube-public       Active   32m
kube-system       Active   32m
```

We can now try creating a Deployment in the `default` namespace and observe the injected proxy. We will create a deployment called `my-nginx` with a single container using image `nginx`:

```
$ kubectl create deploy my-nginx --image=nginx
deployment.apps/my-nginx created
```

If we look at the Pods, you will notice there are two containers in the Pod:

```
$ kubectl get po
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-nginx-6b74b79f57-hmvj8   2/2     Running   0          62s
```

Similarly, describing the Pod shows Kubernetes created both an `nginx` container and an `istio-proxy` container:

```
$ kubectl describe po my-nginx-6b74b79f57-hmvj8
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message

  Normal  Started    76s   kubelet            Started container istio-proxy
```

To remove the deployment, run the delete command:

```bash
$ kubectl delete deployment my-nginx
deployment.apps "my-nginx" deleted
```

### Updating and uninstalling Istio

In case we want to update the current installation or change the configuration profile, we will need to update the `IstioOperator` resource deployed earlier.

To remove the installation, we have to delete the `IstioOperator`, for example:

```bash
$ kubectl delete istiooperator -n istio-system demo-istio-install
```

Once the operator deletes Istio, we can also remove the operator by running:

```bash
$ istioctl operator remove
```

Make sure to delete the IstioOperator resource first before deleting the operator. Otherwise, there might be leftover Istio resources.
